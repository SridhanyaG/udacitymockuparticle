Project Submission

Practice HTML syntax by converting a mockup of a blog article into a real website!

Project Submission
Take a moment to double check that your index.html file renders exactly like the mockup! You do not have to match the margins (spacing along the sides) of the mockup.
Make sure you've answered all the questions for the reflection. Feel free to use your native language! Graders will translate if necessary.
Check your project against the Project Rubric.
Create and submit a zip file containing index.html and reflections.txt.
