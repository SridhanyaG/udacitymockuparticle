Your response goes here!
#### What new skills have you learned?
* Read the problem statement more than once
* Write down the usecases
* Refer MDN for syntax
* code it and review and add good practices if it is missed.  Ex : Alt text for Image
#### What has been easy?
* Mdn reference was informative
* HTMl validators that are available online guide us when errors or obselete tags used. For example i used strike tag which is obselete. Alternate options proposed was css.
* Sublime editor autocomplete and intelisence is helpful.
#### What has been difficult ?
* I am confused sometimes to choose right tag. i and em tag both gave italic effect. Not sure which is better.
* Mdn contents are vast. So i end up reading on the surface.
#### How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
Yes.
